@everyone :rocket: **Legends of SOL have been cooking** :rocket:

Guess what Legends? **Legends of Sol** is the **first** group in the entire Solana ecosystem to integrate **pubkey version 2**! :tools::sparkles:

A huge shoutout to the legendary @beeman.dev  :bee: for his based skillz in delivering the next version of pubkey. Most of you have seen him shit posting in the Discord and gathering market intelligence over the last couple of weeks. It's a pretty big deal to have a dev of his calabre so engaged with what we're cooking tbh. And it's also a testament to the strength of this Discord that he is comfortable testing in prod and rolling with the punches. We're forged in fire mfers.

As a result, for those who've lettuce handed their Choice NFT, you might've noticed a change - access to #üé™-‚ùÖ-the-circus  is no longer available. :circus_tent::x: But here's where it gets exciting...

Holding **$LEGEND tokens** in your connected pubkey wallet now unlocks a brand new role - @$legend holder . :military_medal: This is going to be your gateway to the realm of the cabal for people with $LEGEND. With this update, we're introducing a sophisticated level of access control, tailored to your NFT holdings and token possession. :key2::briefcase:

This advancement isn't confined to Discord alone; it extends to the suite of apps and tools we're currently rolling out. :calling::wrench: The silence over the past few days? That's been the sound of our devs hard at work, innovating on multiple fronts. :shushing_face::woman_technologist: TLDR; there's tonnes more stuff ready to drop in the coming days. Wen claim?

Remember, when Legends of Sol goes a bit quiet and the same 5 Legends are posting in the channel, it means we're cooking hard. And wen I say cooking I obv mean Haggis. And rest assured, with the level of talent in this team we're just getting started taking this Bear Market Ark to the promised land. :full_moon::dizzy:

The journey's just begun. LFG! :rocket::milky_way:
