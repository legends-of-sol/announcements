@everyone 🚨 **Legends of SOL Update** 🚨

🏆 **Prize Draws Incoming:**
Harkl is currently working on the mini-app we're going to use for the prize draws. Once delivered, we're going to draw the $MELON and TokenGator prizes, and then release it so anyone can draw a Legends address by traits and do a draw. This will make it easier for our future partners to do their own prize draws, but more than anything, it's just going to be a fun little piece of tech. 🎲

🦸**Latest Traits:** 
In case you missed them, here are 3 new **SUIT** traits we dropped in the last week or so:
- **$PEDRO:** RARE | he's pedro 🎭
- **McDegen:** COMMON | duh, it's a McDonald's outfit for poors 🍔
- **Roaring Kitty:** RARE | celebrating the return of the king except it seems it's not actually him and he may have actually sold his account 🐱👑

🔥 **Alpha:**
**NFT Airdrop Alert:** Legends is gearing up for an NFT airdrop from an as yet unnamed NFT project! 🎉 The top 100 holders of Legends NFTs will soon be airdropped a special NFT from this project. Check if you're in the [top 100 Legend holders with the latest NFT data update here](https://github.com/legends-of-sol/Solana-NFT-collections/blob/main/projects/legends_of_sol/20240515/unique_legends_of_sol_owners_20240515.csv)! If not, you might want to grab an extra [Legend](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/legends_of_sol/) or two to make sure you make the cut. We'll be taking the snapshot sometime in the next 24h. 📸

⭐**It's all Legends all the way down** 
This is just the start of bringing back the vibes we discussed in the previous post. Now that the upgrade tool is mostly working for the majority again, we're green lighting a bunch of stuff that's been held back for the last several weeks. Just in time for the next phase of the bull-run. And as always, perfectly positioned for when NFTs come back! 🚀

LFG! 🚀
