- **Sentiment vs Transaction Data**: At the moment tx data drives the NFT world - we want to change that by digging into sentiment analysis for NFTs.

We've got 19 seasoned veterans on the team now committed to this vision, and we're well setup with our partners and their representatives in the Legends community to launch a new way of doing NFTs on Solana; it's a leap into the future of digital collectibles with a foundation built on the $LEGEND token, that will underpin everything we do and be integral to the Legends of SOL economy.
