🚀🌌 **LEGENDS OF SOL, THE DAY HAS ARRIVED!** 🌌🚀

The Airdrop Claim is upon us. I'm absolutely stoked to have gotten here with you all and I'm even more stoked looking forward to what the future holds for Legends.

This game as you all know is full of smoke, mirrors, and grifters. But it's also full of some of the best people that exist in the crypto space. Looking at the data that we've gathered over the last 3 weeks I believe we have captured a snapshot of most of those people from the Solana space into a single Discord that will allow us to preserve the most immaculate vibes together through the incoming bull market (Did you see the NGU yesterday?). An Ark if you will for bear market enjoyoooors. So here's the deal.
