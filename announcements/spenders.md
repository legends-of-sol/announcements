# :rotating_light: First Inaugural Town Hall and Degeneracy Anonymous Summary :rotating_light:

Hey @everyone! Here's what you missed in our first town hall today :wave: TLDR; It's been an intense couple of days, and I wanted to give you all a quick breakdown of what's been happening behind the scenes, what's next for our airdrop, and some special instructions for our double claimers.

## Last 48 Hours:
- I was on a non-stop coding spree that resulted in some pretty janky code, working late into the night with an unwavering focus to push through the final stages of development and get the claim sorted. It was a race against time, and in my haste, with no tests to speak of and an already crappy codebase heaving with technical debt, I made a few mistakes.
- We encountered several RPC issues that threw unexpected curveballs our way, and currently whenever the app loads up each user makes about 50 RPC requests. Add load to that and you basically just set whichever RPC you're connected to on fire and they start rate limiting you.
- Amidst this RPC chaos, an unforeseen glitch allowed for a double claim on all airdrops. So a bunch of folks got a lot more than they should have. Ultimately, we pulled the tokens from the airdrop wallet so damages were minimal, and it was well worth it really because the degeneracy setting got turned up to 11.

## What's Next - Airdrop V2.0:
- The airdrop is STILL happening, I repeat THE AIRDROP IS STILL HAPPENING! We're going to get a few devs into the codebase, fix the worst of the bugs, and release again. It will likely be on Friday, but we'll give you all at least 24h warning when we have a fixed date.

## Double Claimers - Here's Your Chance to Shine:
If you were one of the special people who managed a double claim, here's an opportunity to turn this into Legend Sauce. Here's what you need to do:

- Reach out to @.cdcruz , @gus.dew , or the @team to make you an @absolute legends  role
- Join the channel https://discord.com/channels/1190413756325429268/1207129751534444564
- Distribute your unintended extra $LEGEND to your favorite NFT community in increments of 69,420 tokens so they can mint The Choice
- Vibe with others who are in the same boat in the Channel, shit post, share ideas, and decide how you max vibe gifting the 69420 $LEGEND to NFT enjooooyors

This not only helps spread the love, but solidifies your status as an @absolute legends  within our community. We are always raising all yachts, frens.

## Alpha
If you weren't there you missed it. Sorry! No refunds.

But it involves a highly reputable web 2.0 company and some IP negotiations.

## Summing up
I understand the past few days have been a rollercoaster (feature not a bug), and totally appreciate the sorts of Legends this is drawing in who have been here before countless times and revel in the degeneracy. These hurdles and breakages are what made us all the most resilient group of Mfers Solana has ever seen. :rocket:

LFG!
