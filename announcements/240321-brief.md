Legends of SOL is set to change the whole Solana NFT space – what originally started as a $LEGEND token airdrop to core Solana OGs who hung tough during the bull market, quickly grew into a delivery aimed at raising the tide for all. With over 70 partner projects locked in, Legends is now delivering tooling to enable any NFT collection to create a trait market place from their existing (and future) NFT attributes. With the launch of the Legends NFT collection in the coming days, Legends will be showcasing The Chooser - an app that will allow 1000 NFT holders of The Choice to upgrade, purchase and swap NFT traits on their PFP at will.
