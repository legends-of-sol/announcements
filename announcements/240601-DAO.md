@everyone üö® **Legends DAO LFG** üö®

As many of you know I've been talking about turning Legends into a DAO. While I can't fully reveal the excellent reasons for doing this just yet (I'm front-running the news), I can start to float what the structure might look like and how we might go about transitioning. For this to work we're going to need the core community to buy in to the idea, but if we can execute it well it will be a net positive for everyone. Anyone who has been a member of Monke DAO knows how complex, but also how rewarding this process can be. And for the right people this could lead to being one of the biggest NFT brands in the space given the depth and legend status of the wider Legends community.

I've arranged a town hall for <t:1719864000:R> to discuss the proposal and answer any questions about the why and the how. https://discord.com/events/1190413756325429268/1257138481138892820. Below is a shortlist for discussion about what needs to happen for this process to work.

üó≥Ô∏è **Elections:**
- Ideally we elect a board of at least 5 people to manage DAO operations
- All Legends assets should be held in a multisig with at least 3 signatories
- People should put their names forward and/or nominate people they want to see form the governance team
- We will use the inbuilt EasyPolls tooling initially for governance decisions
- Only Legends NFT holders will be able to vote (Mythic Legends)
- PubKey will secure roles and votes will be limited to one each

üí∞ **DAO Treasury:**
- Set up a treasury in Realms to manage the funds and assets of the DAO

üìú **Governance Framework:**
- Could use Futurachy for voting by Meta DAO - [Futarchy Overview](https://docs.themetadao.org/futarchy/overview).
- Can eventually migrate to Realms for governance and voting by wallet if/when necessary - [Realms Documentation](https://docs.realms.today/)

üìñ **Documentation and Transparency:**
- Provide documentation for the DAO's operations (see announcements), governance processes, and smart contracts
- Maintain transparency in all activities and decisions

üéÅ **Community Incentives:**
- Create incentives for community participation and contribution
- Consider reward mechanisms for active members and contributors
