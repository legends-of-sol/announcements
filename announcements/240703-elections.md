@everyone,

As per the meeting (recording available pinned in #weneral) this morning I'm pleased to announce the upcoming elections for the Legends DAO Exec! This is a crucial step in ensuring Legends continues and that everyone has an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. Below are the details and instructions for the election process.

## Nomination Process

2. **Nominations**: To nominate yourself or another member, please follow these steps:

   - Include a short post (max 200 words) explaining why the nominee would be a good fit for the Governance Board.

This is an open process, and the DAO Exec will own all the IP created to date for the Legends brand. I'll be advertising this outside of the Legends community to other strong parties who might be interested in the IP. My top priority is to see the continuation of the Legends brand and the success of the DAO whoever should want to take it over.

If you have any questions, please reach out by creating a support ticket.
