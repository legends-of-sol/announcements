@everyone 🚀 **It is with great pleasure to announce, Traits and Pricing** 🚀

There's been some discussion around traits, pricing and structure in #the-circus so I thought it was time to give you all an update.

**What is a Trait?**

Listed under "attributes" in NFT metadata, a trait is just an item equipped to your NFT. For example - Solana Shades on the eyes section. With The Chooser and swappable traits - it's a way to customize your NFT and make it your own.

🌟 **Trait Pricing** 🌟
Like everything Trait Pricing is subject to change as we adapt to the swirling market, but the feeling generally is that we've got the formula right for this:
- **Common**: :ll:69
- **Uncommon**: :ll:20069
- **Rare**: :ll:69420
- **Epic**: :ll:206969
- **Legendary**: :ll:420690
- **Mythic**: :ll:694200

🔥 **Trait Inventory** 🔥
We're upping the game and going with an unlimited supply of traits - but each NFT will only be able to purchase a single item of each trait. Prices and rarity will be the gatekeeper so if you have enough $LEGEND you can add ALL traits to your NFTs inventory and swap them as you please. We wanted to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to get the traits they want, and that there's no rush to secure your favorites.

📅 **Upcoming Features** 📅
When The Chooser launches this will be the first delivery iteration. But we have ongoing plans for future features and revenue for Legends NFTs:
- **One of Ones**: What we were previously calling The King Without Choices (a single Mythic skin) are now One of Ones. These will be a single item with multiple traits that when equipped will be the only item an NFT can have as a trait attribute.
- **Honoraries**: One of Ones opens the door for honoraries.
- **The King Without Choices**: We're planning something fun for this. More details later.
- **Seasons and Limited Releases**: Just like Fortnite we're planning Seasons, Colabs, and Limited Release of traits so you can flex your tribal affiliations.
- **Ejectable traits**: NFTs traits can be equipped and unequipped once purchased on launch. In the future though, traits can be split out into their own NFT to trade on a Market Place.
- **Meme Season**: Given the teams affinity with memes and degen culture, we've got plans to leverage the current thing. You want a Nick trait because you Choose Rich every time? Or Spoderman traits because you love Graet Sweg? It's going to be degen AF.
