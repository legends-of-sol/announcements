GM Legends! ðŸŒ… I can't believe that in just over 30 days, from the initial idea to delivery, we're on the eve of *The Choice*. It's been the craziest ride, starting with a vision to capture a snapshot of the greatest bear market enjoyooors post-FTX collapse, those who bonded in the deepest, darkest market that Solana will ever know in its history.

Now that we're here, and we've gathered the Legends together, the numbers show that we have all the most OG of OG people from Solana together. I wanted to share some significant updates...

As some of you know, I have a rather demanding full-time job as a full-stack developer in New Zealand. The last three years, building on Solana, have been the busiest years of my life, juggling what essentially amounts to more than two full-time roles. It's certainly taken me through great highs and some really big lows. I built Solana's [first social network](https://boom.army) with a vision to have a completely decentralized, open alternative to Twitter. It was really a fool's errand because, with just one guy, no team, and no funding, it was never really going to be possible, and I also made some mistakes along the way but I'm still proud of what I delivered. The funny thig was, just like we found through the bear market, through all those challenges, hard times, and problems, I met some of the most amazing people who I have ever had the pleasure to meet in my life and who I consider some of my best friends. It was those people who kept me going, and it's to them that I owe Legends because THEY are the Absolute Legends of SOL. It's true that, going to Breakpoint last year and meeting in real life was up there with the greatest moments of my life. This is all for you.

**Here's where we stand pre-snapshot:**

- **Total Legends:** 58,023
- **Total Partners:** 83
- **Total Verified Legends:** 5,223

*Mind-blowing.*

I quickly want to give a huge shout-out to all the members of the Legends team who have worked tirelessly over the last couple of weeks to keep everyone informed and keep the wheels greased and the oil flowing. It was really a team effort, even though most people haven't seen the craziness going on behind the curtain.

Overall, I'm so happy to have been able to capture and tokenize this group of Legends before the real bull market craziness kicks off in the next few months. If any of you have been around the space for any amount of time, you know we're about to head into the Bitcoin halving, which is the Grand-daddy blockchain tide on which all other blockchain boats rise. And as many of you remember, with the bull market comes all sorts of horrible grifters, people in it for the money, and generally just not great folks. So now that we have this Ark, I'm glad that we've secured a place where we can all continue the greatest vibes ever formed in that bear market as a collective.

I also want to share some ideas about what I plan to do with the Legends community and the $LEGEND token so you know what you're in for:

- If Legends burns enough liquidity for me to leave my IRL job, I am going to run a huge experiment and tokenize myself as a dev into Harkl DAO for 6 months and use $LEGEND for people to bid on whatever dev tasks they want me to complete (did I mention I also do design and marketing and a whole bunch of other stuff).
- With the almost 80 partners we've onboarded, as I've dug into the code on many of their collections, they are in all sorts of different states. I want to fix that. So, I'm going to focus on building tooling that levels all of these communities up and makes them the strongest they've ever been.
- There's so much great data in this space, but it's all typically transactional and, ironically, most of the space runs on sentiment. I want to change the way we measure projects, and I have almost completed an app which I think is going to be one of the best sentiment measuring tools for tokens and communities that's ever been built.
- There's too much focus on exit liquidity in the space, which is why we're going to be BURNING ALL of the $LEGEND tokens that are used to make The Choice, raising everyone's boats again.
- And along the way, I've met some absolutely cracked devs in Solana, so I want to have the quality time and freedom to get alongside them and become better at my craft, and help to improve their products to onboard the next billion users into Solana.

My heartfelt thanks to you all. Whatever happens from here, it's not about the liquidity for me; we've done it. We've captured the greatest snapshot of the Solana Bear Market Community I could have ever hoped for, and I'm here for the long haul with you all. Let's make history together. ðŸš€

LFG
