:rocket: **GM Legends!** :rocket:

Exciting news for @everyone! Thanks to the incredible efforts of @rabbagast  and @cryptomiester , we're thrilled to announce the reopening of the Legend claim. This isn't just software for Legends, it's [open sourced](https://github.com/crypt0miester/merkle-airdropper) and will benefit the WHOLE Solana community for all future airdrops. We give back mfers.

:star2: The new claim tool is now live at [claim.legendsofsoul.com](http://claim.legendsofsol.com). Of course if you hold [The Choice NFT](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/the_choice) and are one of our @certified legends  in #üé™-‚ùÖ-the-circus  you had an inside track to this info over 12 hours ago. But if you're just finding out about it now, head to the claim URL and get your $LEGEND secured.

NB: :hourglass_flowing_sand: The claim window is open for the next 48 hours only. Don't miss out, as any unclaimed [$LEGEND](https://birdeye.so/token/LGNDeXXXaDDeRerwwHfUtPBNz5s6vrn1NMSt9hdaCwx?chain=solana) will return to the treasury forever to be unclaimed. And @partners - get the word out to your communities to claim that shit!

ALSO, hold onto your butts! Because this is an announcement about another announcement. (LFG) :tada: Once the claim window closes, we're gearing up to reveal HOW The Choice NFT is going to work and what we've been cooking in the dark. This reveal isn't only going to be about Legends; it's a colab with some of our awesome partners and the specific super-powers that they bring that are #OPOS.

Fresh off a 2-hour brainstorming session for this delivery, our team is literally shitting their pants with excitement for what's ahead for the Legends of SOL. The future is SUPER-SAIYAN, and now we've done the drop we're just getting warmed up. :muscle:

Missed the pre-reveal mint and don't have a Choice NFT? Damn that sucks bro! But, a very limited selection (< 2% of the supply) is still up for grabs on the [secondary market via tensor](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/the_choice).

LFG, Legends! :gem:
