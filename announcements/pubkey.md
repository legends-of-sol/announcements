ðŸŽ‰ **ANNOUNCING NEW ROLE: CERTIFIED LEGENDS FOR LEGENDS OF SOL** ðŸŽ‰

Prepare to ascend to a new echelon within the Legends of SOL community @everyone. We're rolling out an exclusive new role for the connoisseurs of The Choice NFT â€” **Certified Legends**. This isn't just a title; it's your actual key to the inner sanctum, where the elite convene and collaborate.

**Elevate to Certified Legend:**

1. **Hold The Choice**: To qualify for this prestigious role, you must be the proud owner of The Choice NFT. If you're not already a holder, you can still mint one from the [Legends of SOL](https://legendsofsol.com) website.
2. **Verification via PubKey**: With the tech wizardry of @beeman, we're leveraging PubKey for a frictionless verification process.
3. **Initiate at [Dean's List Verification](https://verify.deanslist.services/)**: Sync your Discord and connect your wallet. Ensure it's the wallet that's home to your NFTs. Got multiple wallets? No problem. You can link them all from the Settings.
4. **Transformation**: Post a brief 30-minute interlude, you'll be donning your new role and unlocking the gates to our exclusive channels.

**Hats off to:**
- @beeman, for pioneering the PubKey tech that makes this all possible. Anticipate more innovation with the upcoming version of PubKey, promising deeper integration and perhaps even a custom-branded Discord bot for our legion.
- Also Dean's List DAO, for their pivotal role in hosting the PubKey instance, powered by their commitment as a Platinum Tier Legends Partner.

This new role comes with its share of power and privilege, and we trust you'll wield it with integrity. The verified channels are our playground for the true Legends to onnovate, connect, and grow the fucken pie.

Step up, take the helm, and solidify your legacy as a **Certified Legend**.

ðŸš€ **To Greater Heights, Legends of SOL!** ðŸš€
