🚀 **Yo Legends!** 🚀

We're going to open the claim window for The Choice holders airdrop shortly so gird up your loins @everyone and get ready! 📢🔜
Just a few hours after The Choice claim window opens, The Chooser will go live and @Legends will be able to use their airdrop to purchase traits in The Chooser and pimp their NFTs to their own taste and style. You would have already spotted a bunch of these dropping from our testing in prod. 🛍️💥

The Choice claim will remain open for a week to give holders plenty of opportunity to claim their tokens. ⏳🔓

The Chooser site is optimized for web and mobile and from the testing we've done so far works seamlessly in Solflare and Phantom. It's all 8=bit video game style and it looks DOPE AF! 🎮👾

The Legends token is sitting at an all-time low relative to the previous all-time high. Do what you will with this information... 📉🤔

The upshot is that we have a fully functioning upgradable hot swappable NFT experience that is the first of its kind on Solana in terms of scale and delivery. 🚀🆕

The excitement around our project has been massive, and this event marks the moment we've all been waiting for to enable the team to go full-time on Legends. Achieving so much in just 3 months part-time, imagine the heights we'll reach with a full-time squad of GOATs. It's going to be biblical. 🙌📈

We've got some fun stuff planned for launch as well. Competitions to win traits and NFTs on the usual channels to blow this thing up. 🎉🏆

Not to mention doubling down on our @partners with the best colabs planned you'll see this cycle. I am SO MFING PUMPED. 💪🤝

The Legends NFT collection, with all upgraded NFTs, is hitting Tensor and will be tradable soon. 🚀🔄

As a final note, I'm super humbled and grateful to the @Legends who have galvanized this community in the last 3 months. Also to the @Team who have worked tirelessly across a huge variety of channels and services to get LoS to this point. I never imagined in my wildest dreams we would have got to this point, but you've all kept the faith and we're about to see what happens when you combine a legit group of people, dope NFT pixel art, and a whole new set of utility for NFTs on Solana. This is what we've all been waiting for! LFG 🎉🔥
