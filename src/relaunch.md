@everyone :sparkles: **Attention Legends of SOL!** :sparkles:

After such a great disaster/success of our last launch of the $LEGEND token claim, we're back for more punishment! :fire:

Here's the new date, mfers:

:calendar: **Date:** <t:1708124400:F> 

After you pick yourself up off the floor from the shock of this project not being a rug, here's what else you need to know:

:point_right: **What's going on?**
- **The $LEGEND token claim window will last for 3 days!**
- If you spam "wen" in the chat and don't read this, there's a good chance you'll be **kicked** for not being Legendary enough
- **Reading is fucking awesome**
- **You should read more often**
- We'll have a town hall once we mint out and I'll share some alpha _(I've got the stage sorted this time and I won't do it from my mobile, promise)_

@here If you want to celebrate, do it by heading over to Ian Cummings' post on X and write "**Velvet Fist**" in the comments https://twitter.com/iancummingsnft/status/1758319249200705977! :star2:
