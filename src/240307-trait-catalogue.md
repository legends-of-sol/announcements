**Whatâ€™s New in the Traits Catalogue:**

If you're like me you love pouring over the different geeky elements and detail of passion projects. This is why I'm giving you all a heavy dose of alpha so you can plan your perfect Solana PFP and rep your Legendary status as a bear market enjoyoooor:

- **Backgrounds that are dreamy**: From the memeable "Bonk Sunrise" to the artistic reproduction of real art (The Scream) in "The LFG", @flamulus  has smashed it out of the park with the backgrounds artwork.
- **Eyes that take snapshots in your bedroom**: Choose from epic "3D Glasses" to the mythic "Lightning Eyes" and stare into the windows of your Legends SOL.
- **Suits for Every Occasion**: Whether you're a Bonk maxi or a legendary SMB lover, we've got a suit for every occasion.
- **Mouths to kiss your mother with**: Express your Legend's true emotions and say it like it is.

**Trait Swapping Inbound:**

The whole focus of this project is super-charging traits in the SOL ecosystem, so once The Chooser launches swapping traits on your Legends will be as easy as clicking a few buttons, and dropping a bit of $LEGEND. The official release isn't that far away frens so you better be fucking ready to customize your NFTs on the fly.

**LFG!** :rocket::rocket::rocket:
