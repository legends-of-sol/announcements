**Yo fam, brace yourselves!** :sunrise:

**To @everyone especially the alpha chasers rocking the Colosseum hackathon, despite the Solana speed bumps:** :rocket: We're dropping a massive ** :ll: 3M $LEGEND prize pool** :moneybag:.

How do I become eligible you might ask? :thinkge: 

@Mythic Legends can now equip that gator skin on your Legend NFT (if you can land a tx with the network issues) :eyes::crocodile:.

**Hold fast:** Keep your vibes high and your Legend NFT in gator gear :crocodile:, and you could cop the entire **3 million $LEGEND treasure** :gem:. We're going to be selecting one lucky Gator equipped Legend to bestow the full drop on :trophy:. Itâ€™s all about capitalizing on a single pure moment of Gator Glory :star2:.

This move isn't just about the prize. It's about showcasing what's possible with the best partners in the biz - **Token Gated Traits** bitches! :door::key: 

Want to send a specific airdrop to a specific set of Legend traits? We got you fam :punch:. 

Want to create a DAO with your favorite Bandito hat enjoyers? Also got you :tophat::cowboy:. 

Want to segment off a shitcoin community based on a trait that relates to your shitcoin? Mfer, we got you! :poop::moneybag:

And don't worry, we'll be running this until the network is well and truly fixed so you'll have plenty of time to enjoy the gator glory :crocodile::sparkles:. Same goes for all other announced deadlines eg. The Claim.

**Do you see? LFG** :rocket::fire:
