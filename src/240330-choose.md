Yo @Legends ! The moment we've all been eagerly waiting for has finally arrived. :star2:

Over the past 4 to 5 weeks, we've been neck deep in code working on The Chooser. During this period, we've also been busy allocating airdrop allocations to all of you holding the Choice NFT. :gift: You can check the balance of all accounts who have been allocated on the [Legends github here](https://github.com/legends-of-sol/Solana-NFT-collections/blob/main/legends/the_choice_snapshot_rewards.json). And it's time to claim.

:bell: **Get your claim on!** :bell:

[Connect your elligible wallet here](https://claim.legendsofsol.com/) to claim your Legend allocation. All claims are on chain and secure. The Chooser countdown is on and we're ready to go live on https://legendsofsol.com, so you'll need that [$LEGEND](https://birdeye.so/token/LGNDeXXXaDDeRerwwHfUtPBNz5s6vrn1NMSt9hdaCwx?chain=solana&tab=recentTrades) to pimp your NFTs with legendary and mythic traits in the next few hours. :boom:

This marks a huge milestone for the Legends, but remember, it's just the beginning of our journey. Like everything around here it's going to be legendary! :rocket:

It's been a beautiful process so far, and as we grow bigger and double down on our plans I can only see it getting better. Here's to the best bull market ever. :purple_heart:

LFG! :hugging:
