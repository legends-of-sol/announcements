# 🌟 We think you’re a Legend 🚀

👑 As stalwarts through the bear market, the Legends of SOL team would like to honor you and your community. Prepare for an SPL Token airdrop journey, leading to a momentous decision...

## 🎉 WHAT IS IT?

An airdrop of $LEGEND SPL tokens to your community with token utility that will lead to a difficult choice referred to as “The Choice” from here on.

### 🚚 Delivery

- People will claim their airdrop allocation at LegendsOfSOL.com by connecting Twitter
- Once the claim window closes “The Choice” will be presented at LegendsOfSOL.com

## 💡 THE CHOICE

Each $LEGEND holder faces "The Choice" - a defining moment revealing your true essence as a seasoned crypto native. 
What secrets does "The Choice" hold? 
Only the steadfast will discover.

## 🌐 HOW TO ENGAGE

For you and your community, this is a minimum effort and maximum fun opportunity. If you want to engage respond in the affirmative and you’ll be given a partner role invite to the Legends of SOL Discord to keep up with all delivery info.

From there, in the next few weeks all you’ll have to do is schedule 5 tweets over several days from your project Twitter account at key stages of the airdrop delivery (we will provide templates for each Tweet at the given time).

There is no requirement for your community to register on the airdrop tool as we will be airdropping to your collection by Collection ID. However anyone who wants the absolute maximum allocation of tokens would be wise to connect and verify.
