Thought it was high time to do a bit of a recap of another crazy week in the Legends space.

**Here's the TLDR:**
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Our **Coingecko listing** is now live! Check it out [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/legends-of-sol).
- :tools: The **Chooser** is now 50% complete. SOON!
- :handshake: We're cooking behind the scenes with some super partners. SOON!
- :rocket: Our economics team is smashing it, and we're benefitting from their cabal.
- :movie_camera: Doubling down on **video content** production.
- :clap: Our mods are pwning, uncovering incredible opportunities.
- :moneybag: $LEGEND now has a short form token symbol - ℒ.
- :mega: The code cracking comp is... ongoing

**The Chooser Alpha - What’s Coming:**

The Chooser is set to supercharge the NFT space on Solana - it's a pioneering move at this scale as a protocol.As per usual, Legends of SOL is going to deliver everything with our trademark brand of Legendegeneracy. If you've been living under a rock here's some of the alpha we've dropped so far about what The Chooser is.

- An NFT with **hot swappable traits**.
- Transforming the Legend site so you can swap traits at will.
- A single **MYTHIC trait** named *The King Without Choices*.
- Traits purchasable with $LEGEND, priced by rarity (An economy baby).
- An **API** for Solana projects to enable hot swapping traits on THEIR own NFTs.

And it's all going to be delivered just in time for the most epic part of the bull run.

**Code Cracking Competition Recap:**
We hosted a Legendary competition where I obfuscated ℒ1M $LEGEND in an account, hiding the key in an image on Github using steganography. The @Legends of SOL activated and it took them just over 24 hours to crack the code, with many devs collaborating to find the key. In true crazy Legends form, due to a Unicode conversion error, a single character in the key was altered by the algorithm. Oddly, the key still could be imported to the Solana cli and returned a valid address, but nothing could be transferred from the wallet! Does this qualify us for a Solana bounty? I have NFI, but what I do know is that we're going to double down. I've added another ℒ1M $LEGEND and a Choice NFT to the wallet and we're going to run it back. I promise it will be less dev oriented this time around too.

So Stay tuned for more updates and get ready for another round of code cracking!
