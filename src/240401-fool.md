Yo @Legends ! 🌟

We've just wrapped up The Chooser launch, and the stats are in! Here's the lowdown:

- ℒ96M claimed so far! 💰
- Over ℒ106M spent on traits since we kicked off. 🛍️
- 516 NFTs have been upgraded to Legends - that's 1/4 of The Choice! 🎨
- We're boasting a super low gini coefficient which means the spread of Legends holders looks amazing. 📉
- And, we're on par with Mad Lads (staked) at a gini coefficient of 0.43. 🤝
- The artwork reception was a MASSIVE success - people love it
- Metaplex has doubled down with CORE, and Legends is right at the tip of the spear for being one of their blue chips

In short, every metric that was key to long term success of Legends of SOL hit the target. So I can happily announce that Phase 2 is 100% ALL GO!

Easter gave the @team a moment to breathe and relax after a non-stop delivery schedule. 🐣 We're gathering in 24 hours to strategize on Phase 2. There's a ton of exciting stuff on our non-roadmap that's going to take things to the next level. 🚀

Guess what? Other projects are already knocking on our door, eager to use the Legends API to make their collections upgradable. Add a trait marketplace to the mix, and we're looking at rocket fuel for growth. 🌌

Ejectable traits are on the horizon! Make sure your NFTs are fully loaded because we'll be dropping a whole new season collection at some stage. This means some of the OG traits will become rare finds. It's all about the seasons, baby. 🍂🌸

Our token took a huge hit in the last 24h - one account jeeted their entire $10K worth of $LEGEND. NGMI. But remember, NFTs are feeling a lot like Solana at $8 right now. We're at the forefront, ready to lead the next bull-run. 📈 The potential of hot swappable traits is just beginning to be understood. We're pioneering this tech, and it's what NFTs were truly meant for.

So sit back and relax. We got this. I'm not going anywhere. The community is stronger than ever, and there's plans afoot to give you more ownership. Our devs are still some of the best in the game. The artwork still bangs like a firecracker. 

LFG 🚀🚀🚀
